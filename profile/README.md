# Contributions

## How to contribute

When contributing to any of our software, you can contribute by simply forking a repository that we own, which will give you a copy of our repository, and then make your edits to your fork, and then you can submit your edits via a Pull Request, write your title and description, and click submit. We will then review your code.

## Contribution Etiquette

When contributing to our repositories please follow the etiquette:

- Put effort into documenting your changes, code, and comments; this will not only encreese your chances of your code being merged, but it will also help us better understand your changes.
- Test your code before contributing to ensure nothing was broken in the process - even if you edited only a specific class, that class could have been integral to the functionality of the application, and it could break it in the process.
- When contributing prioritize code quality, for example, "DRY" - "Don't Repeat Yourself" - do your research!

## Our stance on AI

We understand writing code is hard, but we also understand vibe coding could be seen as the "Easy way to code" - please, when using AI, use discretion. Please don't just submit nothing but untested AI code, when using AI, test everything vigorously, even on every supported platforms - just because it works on Windows, doesn't necessarily mean it works on Linux.
